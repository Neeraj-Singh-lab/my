<p>Ours s a country of Saints, sages and sadhus, yet the problem of beggars exist in our society. Today it is a matter of great shame for everyone. It is assumed wide dimensions. It is estimated that there are about 5 lakh beggars in India. Indeed, begging has become a profession. We come across beggars at the bus stops , in street , outsides the temples, near traffic lights, bazaars, rubbish damps, road sides etc. while some are helpless  others are choosing it as a profession as it an easy way to earn money without doing physical work. Beggars are a great nuisance.</p>

<p>Every times a child takes a soft drink; he’s laying the ground work for a dangerous bone disease. No, fizzy and sugar drinks don’t cause Osteoporosis. But, because they are often a substitute for a glass of milk, kids are not getting the calcium and vitamin D they need to build a strong skeleton. Many of them also lead a sedentary lifestyle, so they aren’t getting the bone building benefits for vigorous exercise either. These children aren’t just in jeopardy for brittle bones and fractures decades down the road. They could be at risk of Osteoporosis at a younger age than even before.
              The Indian society for bone and mineral research, a body of Osteoporosis experts, in trying to spread awareness about this bone crippling disease.
              Osteoporosis starts in childhood but has consequences later in life. The condition causes bones to become riddle with holes, like the framework of  house that’s been attacked by termites. Treat can lead to broken bones, which in turn can cause deformity, chronic pain or disparity. Osteoporosis can be fatal: up to 25 percent of older people who suffer a broken hip die within a year. Osteoporosis isn’t just your grandmother’s health threat. Although it strikes over 50 million women in India, it also menaces over 12 million men. Osteoporosis cause loss of height, pain in joints and back, fractures and a fear of fractures , and can be very depressing . So it is important that we adopt preventive measures, to save millions of peoples.
